# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:


# Israr-Khan-Portfolio

Starter portfolio scaffold focused on Usability, Accessibility, Performance, Maintainability, and Clear Architecture.

Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

What this scaffold includes

- Accessible layout with skip link and keyboard-friendly navigation.
- Lazy-loaded routes and components for improved performance.
- Focus styles, semantic HTML, and basic accessible patterns.
- Sample projects list and an accessible contact form (client-side demo).

Recommended next steps

- Add real project images to the `public/` folder and update `src/utils/projects.js`.
- Connect the contact form to an email service or serverless endpoint.
- Add automated accessibility tests (axe), Lighthouse CI, and visual regression tests.

Files to inspect

- `src/pages/*` — page-level routes
- `src/components/*` — reusable components
- `src/utils/projects.js` — sample project data

This repo is a starting point. If you want, I can:

- Wire up Tailwind properly and a design token system
- Add Lighthouse CI and an example GitHub Actions workflow
- Improve the contact form with Netlify/Vercel functions
